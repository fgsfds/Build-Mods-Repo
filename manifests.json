Feeling no less disdain for the world than he did with Ophelia, and experiencing none of the joy she brought, he returns to the grave to die once more. A hopefully final resting place.\r\n\r\nThe Cabal had been scattered far and wide by the gunman\u0027s path of revenge, but in his absence they regathered, regrouped, motivated out of their own sense of vengeance. Caleb was their general, the chosen one of their dark god and he had betrayed them all twice over.\r\n\r\nHe must burn for rejecting the honor of being sacrificed, for striking at Tchernobog. This suffering is best repaid by the tongues of Cerberus. Gathering his remains, the diaspora cinders of his pit, they enacted plans to resurrect him, and sought out Caleb\u0027s newfound grave, and bring him face to face with a fiery end.\r\n\r\n- A complete brand new episode.\r\n\r\n- Control Caleb as he carves a swath of carnage through the Cabal.\r\n\r\n- Experience ten brand new levels!\r\n\r\n- Using only assets from the original game, crafting a dark and horrific journey for Caleb."
