All levels have been adapted so that Co-op play is not only possible, but enhanced with a helpful checkpoint system. The campaign includes several secret levels which all connect back to their episodes through special transitional missions.\r\n\r\nThe entire mod was developed by a single mapper, Bloatoid, who has been editing with the Build engine for many years. The original Death Wish was created between January 2010 and October 2011. Updates have been made over the years based on feedback from players and observing online streamers, as well as the addition of several extra secret levels. A 4th episode is in development.\r\n\r\nLet the festival of Blood continue!",

A hopefully final resting place.\r\n\r\nThe Cabal had been scattered far and wide by the gunman\u0027s path of revenge, but in his absence they regathered, regrouped, motivated out of their own sense of vengeance. Caleb was their general, the chosen one of their dark god and he had betrayed them all twice over.\r\n\r\nHe must burn for rejecting the honor of being sacrificed, for striking at Tchernobog. This suffering is best repaid by the tongues of Cerberus. Gathering his remains, the diaspora cinders of his pit, they enacted plans to resurrect him, and sought out Caleb\u0027s newfound grave, and bring him face to face with a fiery end.\r\n\r\n- A complete brand new episode.\r\n\r\n- Control Caleb as he carves a swath of carnage through the Cabal.\r\n\r\n- Experience ten brand new levels!\r\n\r\n- Using only assets from the original game, crafting a dark and horrific journey for Caleb.",
